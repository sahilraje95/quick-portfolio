**Type:** Live Web-based Application. 

**URL:** http://ccc.msubaroda.ac.in/AnnualRep/

**Organization & Client:** The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara, Gujarat, India

**Project description:** Gathering insights and generating reports for ARMS (a data & report management portal of the organization) in the format specified by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).
AQAR (Annual Quality Assurance Report) is a critical document which depicts overall scenario of the annual tangible institutional growth in the seven criteria identified by NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council). It has to be submitted to NAAC, annually, by all accredited institutions, as per the prescribed format.

**Brief Description about the system:**

Primary users of this system are University Development Officer, Faculty Dean, Head of Department (HOD) and Teaching Staff, which constitute 4 main modules of the system:

**1. University Management:**
* User: University Development Officer / Super admin.
* This user has highest admin rights, can manage all other modules.
* User can generate AQAR (Criteria 1 - 7) for the whole university, academic year-wise (comprising of all Faculties and underlying Departments) in a button click, which is annually submitted to NAAC, as per the prescribed format, guidelines and parameters.
* User can generate/view University-level reports about Papers presented, Events, Activities, Alumni visits etc.

**2. Faculty Management:**
* User: Faculty Dean.
* User needs to provide input of Faculty-specific data for parameters of Criteria 5, 6 and 7 of AQAR, for a particular academic year.
* User can generate AQAR (Criteria 1 - 7) for the Faculty and its underlying departments, academic year-wise, in a button-click. 
* User can manage Faculty-specific details about Profile, Events, Activities, Visitors, Placements, Alumni visits, Collaborations, Infrastructure and Learning Resources etc.

**3. Department Management:**
* User: Head of Department (HOD).
* User needs to provide input of Department-specific data for parameters of Criteria 5, 6 and 7 of AQAR, for a particular academic year.
* User wonâ€™t be able to generate AQAR (Criteria 1 - 7) for itself.
* User can manage Department-specific details about Profile, Events, Activities, Visitors, Awards, Placements, Alumni visits, Collaborations, Infrastructure and Learning Resources, Staff (Teaching and Non-Teaching), PhD Details etc.

**4. Teacher Management:**
* User: Teaching Staff.
* User can manage details about their personal Profile, Research and Consultancy Projects, Books/Papers published, Academic Programs (Participation / Organisation / Role in Academic Bodies or Universities), Awards/Performance, Talks etc.
* User can generate their own CV in a button-click.
